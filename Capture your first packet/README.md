# Capture Your First Packet with tcpdump

In this lab, I used the `tcpdump` command-line tool on a Linux system to capture and analyze live network traffic. I practiced identifying network interfaces, recording traffic, saving it as a packet capture file, and filtering the data to focus on specific traffic.

## Tasks Completed

- Identified available network interfaces on the machine  
- Used `tcpdump` to capture live packets in real time  
- Saved captured traffic to a `.pcap` file for later analysis  
- Applied capture and display filters to isolate relevant traffic  

## Skills Gained

- Hands-on experience using `tcpdump` for packet capture  
- Understanding how to filter traffic by port, protocol, or IP  
- Generating `.pcap` files for deeper inspection in tools like Wireshark  
- Fundamental knowledge of network traffic monitoring from the command line  

This lab provided critical exposure to network-level investigation techniques, useful in intrusion detection, incident response, and traffic auditing.
