# 1. List all network interfaces
ip link show
# or
tcpdump -D

# 2. Capture traffic from a specific interface (e.g., eth0)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0

# 3. Save captured traffic to a file
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture_output.pcap

# 4. Filter traffic by port (e.g., HTTP)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80

# 5. Filter traffic by protocol (e.g., ICMP)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp

# 6. View saved capture file in readable format
tcpdump -r capture_output.pcap
