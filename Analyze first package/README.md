# Analyze Your First Packet

In this lab, I used **Wireshark** to analyze a packet capture (PCAP) file. I learned how to interpret raw network traffic, apply filters, and examine protocol-level details. This is one of the most critical real-world skills for threat detection, incident response, and forensic analysis.

## Tasks Completed

- Opened a packet capture (PCAP) file using Wireshark  
- Examined packet headers and payloads across multiple protocols (e.g., TCP, HTTP, DNS)  
- Applied Wireshark display filters to isolate and analyze specific traffic (e.g., `http`, `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`)  

## Skills Gained

- Navigating Wiresharkâ€™s user interface  
- Analyzing protocol-level details of network traffic  
- Applying filters to quickly find suspicious or relevant packets  
- Understanding how packet analysis helps in intrusion detection and traffic auditing  

This lab is foundational for anyone aiming to work in threat hunting, digital forensics, or SOC analyst roles.
