# Explore Signatures and Logs with Suricata

In this lab, I worked with Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS), to understand how signatures (rules) detect suspicious network activity and how alerts are generated and logged.

## Tasks Completed

- Examined the structure and components of a Suricata rule  
- Triggered a specific Suricata rule by simulating network traffic  
- Reviewed alert logs generated by Suricata after the rule was triggered  
- Explored the `eve.json` output file to analyze detailed event data  

## Skills Gained

- Understanding IDS/IPS rule syntax and how signatures detect threats  
- Interpreting Suricata alert logs for incident response  
- Familiarity with JSON formatted logs (`eve.json`) for event analysis  
- Hands-on experience with a key security monitoring tool used in SOCs and security teams  

This lab helped me build practical knowledge for detecting and responding to network threats using signature-based IDS systems.
